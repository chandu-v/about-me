          <p> Have you all remember the rock paper scissors game that we used to play in our childhood. I know this is
            not very common game in Indian house holds üòÇ. </p>
          <p> One good day while out of blue I got a thought to develop this game on our mobile devices.</p>
          <p> Mobile devices are very ubiqutous now a days. All most all have one mobile devices in their hand. So, I'm
            very much keen about mobile techologies. Because of many reason from which I'd list down a few of them:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data is the new oil and they give lot of data.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the next big technology will be IoT. It may be because of 5G or any other factor. Already
              lot of big technology and manufacturing companies are using it alot</li>
            <li>The list goes on</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The list is not comprehensive but it gives you an overall picture.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Brainstroming</h2>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The big picture of my game is to build a game that can be played with two
            remotely connected people.</blockquote>

          <p>Here we go. I thought about the game rules. The use has to point his mobile's camera to their hand. On
            count of 3 the user makes a guesture. My algorithm should recognise the gesture and classify it into one of
            the rock , paper, scissor or None of the above.</p>
          <p>Initially, thinking of a two player game. One will be the winner. Alright! Now I'll explain about my
            finding on the algorithm and planning.</p>

              <h4>Recognising the Hand Guesture</h4>
              <p>Thinking on what to do next and how do I proceed ü§î. I googled a lot. Then my results are the
                following:
              </p>
              <li>I found lot of results for recognising hand gestures using opencv. Well! Most of my result were in
                python.
                But thank god OpenCV has a very good documentation for Java as well.</li>
              <li>Then the other way that I found out for doing this is using Machine Learning to classify images.</li>
              <div style="padding-left:1em">

              <h4>
                The OpenCV Way
              </h4>
              <p>I've to found out that recognising the hand guesture is a little bit easy using OpenCV. Many have done
                experiments on recognising the Hand guestures using OpenCV. Most of them recognised the numbers using
                hand
                guestures. Other than numbers few tried recognising the symbols like Oküëç. Perfectüëå etc.,</p>
              <p>I'll tell you how it works:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>We detect a particular colour in the frame.</li>
                <li>We detect countour(edges) and hulls in the image.</li>
                <li>Using the angle between the hulls we will determine how many fingers and opened. If there are 2
                  fingers opened, it will be scissors, if 5 it's paper and if it's 0 it's stone.</li>
              </ol>
              <p> But this needs a plane background with less disturbance. I can make a game, but I don't know how well
                it
                will be received. On this conclusion I thought of the Machine Learning way</p>

              <h4>
                The Machine Learning way
              </h4>
              <p>With remarks from opencv I started looking into tensorflow lite</p>

              <p>And there are lot of things to cover in this blog. I'll keep updating this blog. </p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a
            marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so
            delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a
            man.</p>
